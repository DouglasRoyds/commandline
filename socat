          /dev/ttyUSB0,b57600,raw,echo=0'                Single-quote to ensure that tty is run remotely, not locally.

socat $(tty),rawer,escape=0x1d \
      EXEC:"ssh user@hostname \
         socat - '/dev/ttyUSB0,b57600,rawer'",pty,setsid,ctty
                                                Serial over ssh the socat way.
                                                If we don't single-quote the parameter set, the serial port doesn't get configured.
                                                I'm not getting Ctrl-D through to the remote end yet.
