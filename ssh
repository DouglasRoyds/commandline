ssh-keygen
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/username-on-hostname Generate a public/private key pair
                                          They are normally put into ~/.ssh/id_rsa & id_rsa.pub
                                             -f       Put the key-pair in this file (and filename.pub)

ssh-copy-id user@remote.box
ssh-copy-id -i publickeyfile user@remote.box
                                          Copy the public key to the target server,
                                          and append it to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
                                             -i       This public key file, instead of the default ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

apt-get install openssh-server            The target server must be runing openssh-server
                                          The first time the ssh server runs, it generates a host key in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

ssh-add                                   Store all default (unencrypted) ssh keys in the ssh agent, by default the gnome-keyring.
ssh-add -l                                List
eval $(ssh-agent)                         Start a new ssh-agent instance, independently of gnome-keyring
env | grep SSH                            It's listening on a different socket.
                                          Login to a server requiring an encrypted key, and the password
                                          will only be stored in this new ssh-agent instance, within this
                                          shell. The instance will exit when the shell exits, leaving the
                                          encrypted key effectively locked. This does *not* make the key
                                          secure within your current user space. An attacker with your user
                                          rights will be able to use the unlocked key via the socket â€” but
                                          it's better than leaving it unlocked for the duration of your
                                          login session.

                                             -f       Put ssh into the background after asking for a passphrase,
                                                      but before running the remote command
                                             -i       Use this particular key-pair (which won't ask for a passphrase)

ssh-keygen -R hostname.com                Remove the named host from my known_hosts file
