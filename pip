pip help
pip list                   Installed packages and versions

sudo -H pip install packagename     Install
                                       -H             Set the HOME var, for pip caching
                                                      (otherwise it complains noisily)
                                       --upgrade      Upgrade if already installed
sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip   Upgrade pip itself (to silence its out-of-date complaints)
