ssh-keygen
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/username-on-hostname Generate a public/private key pair
                                          They are normally put into ~/.ssh/id_rsa & id_rsa.pub
                                             -f       Put the key-pair in this file (and filename.pub)

ssh-copy-id user@remote.box
ssh-copy-id -i publickeyfile user@remote.box
                                          Copy the public key to the target server,
                                          and append it to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
                                             -i       This public key file, instead of the default ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

apt-get install openssh-server            The target server must be runing openssh-server
                                          The first time the ssh server runs, it generates a host key in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

ssh username@172.25.206.14                Login over ssh
ssh     username@hostname.local           If both machines are running avahi
ssh -X  username@hostname.local
ssh -Xf username@hostname.local firefox
ssh -Xf username@hostname.local -i ~/.ssh/username-on-hostname firefox
                                             -X       Enable X11 forwarding
                                             -f       Put ssh into the background after asking for a passphrase,
                                                      but before running the remote command
                                             -i       Use this particular key-pair (which won't ask for a passphrase)

ssh-keygen -R hostname.com                Remove the named host from my known_hosts file
