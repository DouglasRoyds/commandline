gcc main.c
gcc main.cc
gcc main.c -o executable
                                       Compile main.c
                                          -o executable     Otherwise defaults to a.out
                                          -l libname        Use this library (as well as libstdc)
                                          -L libpath        Add this path to the library search path
                                          -Wall             All warnings

gcc -print-search-dirs                 Where is it going to look for libraries?
