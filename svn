svn checkout URL                       Checkout into the current directory, creating a new subdirectory
svn checkout URL path/                 Checkout files into path/. No new subdirectory will be created - the files and
                                       directories under URL will all be put directly into path/

svn log -v                             Name modified, deleted, and added files in the current directory

svn log | gawk '/roydsd/{print "-" $1}' | xargs -r svn log
                                       My commits only. svn log can take multiple -r11111 options
                                          -r    Don't run the log if there is no input to xargs

svn copy $SVN/thing/trunk $SVN/thing/tags/tagname -m "Description of tag"
svn copy $SVN/thing/trunk $SVN/thing/branches/branchname -m "Description of branch"
                                       The tagname/ or branchname/ directory shoud not exist
                                          --parents      Creates intermediate directories, useful if there isn't already
                                                         a tags/ or branches/ directory
svn copy here/ there/                  Two different outcomes:
                                          there/ does not exist, it puts contents of here into there
                                          there/ already exists, it puts here INTO there
                                       These are the same semantics as cp -r

svn move this that                     Renames this to that
svn move here/ there/                  If there/ already exists, here/ is put inside there/, otherwise renamed to there/
svn move here/* there/                 there/ must already exist.
svn move $SVN/from/here $SVN/target/there -m "Message"
                                       Move semantics are the same as the bash mv command,
                                          --parents      Creates intermediate directories
